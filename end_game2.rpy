"Cette décision que les Loups ont tant adulé pendant des générations, peu importe l'opinion qu'ils portaient à Drusus lui-même."
"Ce choix, offert par les parents pour sauver son empire ou son amour."
"Une peur et une angoisse gelées éclosent dans l'estomac d'Amicus et se répand à tout le reste de son corps, comme si un liquide glacial fuitait depuis son aine à ses jambes."
"Le loup sent ses membres trembler alors qu'il serre l'humain fort contre lui, ses babines se retroussant, son instinct primal de protéger son partenaire entrant en action."
"Pendant un long moment, un laps de temps difficile à évaluer, le loup regarde au loin, dans les abysses."
"Il regarde les étoiles qui virevoltent, les nuages et les planètes, en essayant d'apercevoir..."
"... Apercevoir ces choses qui sont en train de contrôler, de manipuler son destin et son partenaire."
"Tremblant, Amicus secoue la tête, reculant d'un pas, encore, même s'il sait que les parents sont omniprésents."
a "\"N—non...\""
"La mâchoire d'Amicus se serre et il se hait à paraître aussi faible et effrayé."
"Il se remémore alors qui il est. Le loup redresse les épaules, et observe l'espace."
a "\"Non ! Je ne ferai pas une telle décision !\""
"Pour une fois, l'environnement dans lequel les parents réside reste silencieux mais observateur; Amicus peut sentir leur œil qui voit tout pointé  sur sa nuque."
a "V-Vous m'entendez !? Je ne le ferais pas ! Je... Je resterai ici pour toujours si je n'ai pas le choix ! Vous ne pouvez pas nous impliquer dans votre folie !"
"[mc] se détache alors de l'emprise d'Amicus, sa tête pivotant bizarrement, se levant vers le haut d'une manière tout sauf naturelle, comme si des fils tenaient sa tête."
"Amicus a un mouvement de recul, sentant ses poils se hérisser jusque dans sa colonne alors qu'il tente de ne pas laisser tomber l'humain qu'il connaît si bien."
m "\"De la folie?\""
"[mc] le fixe alors d'une expression qu'Amicus n'avait jamais vu sur son visage."
"C'est froid, et presque méprisant, une expression qu'Amicus n'aurait jamais voulu que [mc] fasse."
m "\"Comment cette situation, dans laquelle la vie d'un billion de sapients est au bord de l’anéantissement, appelle-t-elle de telles déclarations enfantines ? Dites-nous, dans quel univers les tentatives d’éviter un résultat aussi catastrophique seraient considérées comme de la 'folie'?\""
"L'humain tourne sa tête soudainement d'une manière artificielle, se rapprochant du loup tandis qu'il perd son souffle, posant sa large patte contre le visage de [mc], tentant d'arrêter ces mouvements {i}inhumains{/i}."
a "\"A-Arrêtez ça ! Ne lui faites pas de mal !\""
"L'humain reste en position pendant un moment, puis semble se détendre à nouveau dans les bras du loup."
"Amicus peut sentir son cœur battre à cent à l'heure."
"Il avait provoqué... Eh bien, pas la colère des parents, peut être les avait-t-il juste énervé, mais l'expérience avait vraiment été terrifiante."
"Voir [mc] être contorsionné d'une telle manière était vraiment dérangeant, certes, mais les parents avaient voulu le faire, et le loup commençait seulement à réaliser pourquoi ils utilisaient son amant comme d'une marionnette."
"La colère et la peur se battaient pour prendre le contrôle du loup, avant que la dernière gagne, se remémorant quelle décision il devrait peut-être faire."
a "\"S'il vous plaît... Il doit y avoir une autre solution, je ne peux pas... Je ne peux pas choisir entre ces deux choses !\""
"Il y a ensuite une pause dans l'air, et Amicus sent ses genoux le lâcher, se préparant à se jeter aux pieds imaginaires de ces êtres monolithiques."
"Il pourrait supplier jusqu'à la fin des temps, en jettant sa fierté lupine par la fenêtre."
m "\"De quelle décision parles-tu ?\""
"Amicus regarde à nouveau en direction des étoles."
a "\"Le—Le choix présenté à Drusus... Celui qui a été décidé pour lui par Meera il y a dix millénaires de cela.\""
"Amicus fronce les sourcils, sachant que les parents voient bien à quoi il fait allusion, le blessant encore plus à lui faire dire ce genre ."
m  "\"Oh, Amicus. Ne connais-tu pas la propension de ton peuple à tordre, exagérer et romantiser la vérité ?\""
"Amicuse reste silencieux, attendant, le cœur toujours battant la chamade, et simplement douloureux à ce point-là"
m "\"Ne te réfère pas à la mythologie lupine pour t'informer sur les désirs des Parents. Nous sommes les seuls à pouvoir te dire la vérité.\""
"Amicus laisse échapper un grognement, sa colère prenant le dessus sur sa peur encore une fois"
a "\"Alors pourquoi faire tout cela ? Pourquoi me tourmenter ainsi ?\""
"Un petit moment de silence passe et Amicus grogne de nouveau, frustré par la manière dont il est traité, comment ses émotions sont manipulées et sculptés comme de l'argile."
"Ce n'était pas du tout ce qu'il avait appris."
"Est-ce que son père avait connu les parents comme ça ?"
"Et son grand-père ?"
"Amicus aurait bien aimé avoir été prévenu avant cette réalisation."
"Alors que le silence pèse de plus en plus, le loup essaie d'enfouir ses émitions afin de ne donner aucun indice à ces déités sur comment il se sentirait, refusant cette attaque odieuse sur son libre-arbitre. "
"Bien qu'il sache à quel point ce soit futile."
m "\"Tu peux ramener ton amour. À ce moment précis, le temps est presque arrêté dans votre réalité. Le corps et l'esprit de [mc] sont toujours sauvables.\""

"Amicus fixe le vide un moment."
a "\"Et si je refuse ?\""

"Amicus secoue la tête, ne voulant pas croire ces paroles, la façon dont les dirigeants du {i}Galaxias{/i} fonctionnent."
m "\"Cela doit être fait.\""
"Le loup est inquiet, pour une fois il souhaita ne pas être dans une telle position, il souhaita pouvoir se retirer dans la campagne calme avec son humain, pour vivre une vie normale..."

        "Amicus seems to like that, because he responds with a growl, leaning in to kiss my neck."
        "The movement sends him deeper, forcing more involuntary moans out of me while at the same time, the action pushes my hips further upward, making me all the more vulnerable."
        "The feeling of exposing myself like this, allowing Amicus access, it's making me leak like never before."
        "When Amicus is finished licking me, he pulls back to begin thrusting into me, slowly at first, then building up speed when I don't complain."

        "Without warning, I pull him in tightly, wrapping my legs around his waist and forcing his length the last few inches in."

"My last full day on Adastra comes just as soon as I thought it would."
"Too soon."
"As I sit on the stone bench, breathing in the cool, early morning air, I find myself trying to think back on the last few months, even the last few weeks."
"It's all a bit blurry."
"The days continued in the same way: me with too much time on my hands, while Amicus was kept busy by a rapidly changing empire."
"With his assigned role already in progress, I've mostly been left to wait, and while the wait seemed tortuously long, it simultaneously seemed unrealistically quick."
"It feels like only last week that I was touring the moon with Amicus, visiting the major cities on our way to pick up Cassius."
"It had been one of the better experiences I had on Adastra, really getting to see how different each part of the moon could be for the first time, despite the basically-universal culture."
"I got to see the breathtaking mountain ranges that surrounded the city of Lux."
"I rode giant, questionably safe amusement rides and ate all kinds of good food in the city of Ad Rotae, basically a giant Las Vegas."
"And all the while, I got to stay in luxurious villas owned by the imperial family, spending much of my time taking walks, fishing, and even hunting with Amicus."
"And then we picked up Cassius and Alex and the trip ended."
"That was over three months ago."
"Ever since then, the only thing I've really focused on is my studies."
"I've learned enough of the language that I can hold stilted conversations with Amicus."
"He always enthusiastically tells me that I'm doing an amazing job, even though I know I probably sound like a very young child to him."
"One with a heavy, clumsy accent."
"..."
"I don't think I've done enough."
"None of this is going to help me with my mission on Earth."
"Not since the experience I had with Amicus in the archives have I heard from the Monitor, let alone the parents."
"Instead, they seem to be content to just let me drift around aimlessly like I always have."
"It's gotten to the point that I even asked Amicus if what happened in the archives {i}actually{/i} happened and wasn't all just a dream."
"And speaking of dreams, I haven't even been given one of those."
"Not even an \"{i}all is well{/i}\" from the space dragon."
"What's most infuriating is that Amicus is in contact with them."
"Of course he's asked on my behalf if they have anything to say to me but...nothing."
"I can only assume it's because they don't want to \"interfere\" with the process, even though they're going to have to tell me {i}something{/i}."
"At least direct where to go first."
"Otherwise they're probably just going to hospitalize me when I show up talking about space wolves and the impending assimilation with the {i}Galaxias{/i}."
"I feel my insides twist uncomfortably like they have been for the past several months, and especially in the past week."
"I'd had to leave Amicus's room because I didn't want to keep waking him up with my tossing and turning."
"That, and lying there awake, watching Amicus sleep innocently next to me is just a bit too much for me right now."
"I know I should be savoring these last moments, but instead, I find myself twisted up in worry."
"I'm going to be alone."
"It's something that hasn't really scared me much before I came here, but after being with Amicus for so long, and now with this path ahead of me..."
"I go from hugging myself to twirling the now-fitted ring on my finger."
"It's been a security blanket of sorts."
"We had debated on whether or not to marry before I leave, but eventually decided Amicus should lay some legal ground work first so as not to cause too much of an uproar."
"He has eight years to do it after all."
"It will give me something to look forward to when I return."
"Our entire lives adjusted to fit the schedule laid out by the parents."
"This is all assuming they're telling the truth and, not for the first time, I wonder if I can really count on them to make sure I return to Adastra."
"They're controlling everything, and I don't think they would be sending me on a mission that would somehow result in me never coming back here."
"That's the whole point."
"I'm uniting two different worlds..."
"I sigh, closing my eyes at the ridiculous weight of that statement."
"This is all wrong."
"I've been trying to ignore it for months, but something here is wrong."
"I open my eyes again as I hear shuffling steps up the path."
"For a moment, I think it's going to be Amicus, maybe having woken up and found me missing from the bed."
"It's what I hope to see, even though I know he needs his sleep."
"I'm under enough stress right now that I'm willing to be selfish."
"But no."
"I'm a bit surprised to see Virginia walking along the main path, head down as she manipulates one of those transparent tablets that the officials around here have."
